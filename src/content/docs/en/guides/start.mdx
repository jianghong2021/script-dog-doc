import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Try to quickly experience ScriptDog by starting a new project (or importing an existing one), and run it after completing the programming.
<Aside type='caution' title='Prerequisites'>
Enable the browser's `Developer mode` (**must**). If it still prompts **Please enable developer mode** after turning it on, please disable this plug-in and enable it again.

There are several ways to do this:
   - Enter `chrome://extensions/` (Chrome) or `edge://extensions/` (Edge) in the browser's address bar.  
   - Navigate to `Settings > Extensions` in the browser.  
   - Use the shortcut button for the `Extensions` management page, usually located in the top-right corner of the browser.  

The toggle for `Developer Mode` is located in the top-right corner in Chrome and the bottom-left corner in Edge, though its position may change with different versions.

<Steps>
1. #### Manage Page
    - Click the plugin icon, or find *ScriptDog* in the right-click menu
2. #### Fill in Project Information
    - Name - Project name
    - Description - Project description
    - Type - *Content Script*, runs on the specified webpage, used to fully customize the current webpage, and can access all ScriptDog functions. *Independent Window*, runs the script in an isolated window. *Sidebar*, same as Independent Window.
        <Aside>
            Currently, *Independent Window* and *Sidebar* run in an isolated sandbox that can access all ScriptDog module functions but cannot access user devices (recording, video recording)
        </Aside>
    - ScriptDog Modules - Check if using ScriptDog modules.
    - GM Modules - If importing GM scripts (Tampermonkey, etc.), it will be checked by default.
    - Project Window - Only effective when the type is *Independent Window*, configure the position, size, etc. when the independent window starts.
    - Content Script - Effective when the type is *Content Script*
        - Match - Specify which webpages the content script runs on, matched by URL, default `*://*/*`, matches all webpages. For example: `https://*.baidu/*` matches all Baidu websites, `https://tieba.baidu.com/*` only matches Tieba.
        - Run Timing - Specify when the script runs
            - Document Start - Runs before all scripts of the webpage itself, at this time it may not be able to operate elements.
            - Document End - Runs after the webpage is ready, at this time some resources of the webpage itself (images, videos, etc.) have not been loaded.
            - Document Idle - Runs when the webpage is fully ready and idle. At this time, all operations are feasible.
3. #### Edit Project
    - Delete - Delete locally, does not affect the cloud.
    - Edit - Modify project information
    - Template - Configure templates for the project, creating elements through code is too troublesome? Then try it!
    - Coding - Script development, default is blockly visual script, if you have programming experience you can also choose text programming mode.
    - Run - Run *Independent Window*, *Sidebar*, *Content Script* does not need to be run manually, just open the matching webpage.
    - Download - Package the project and download it to the disk for sharing with others.
3. #### Import Project
    - ScriptDog's own project, the xxx.json file obtained from the above *Download*.
    - GM script, the xxx.js file of the Tampermonkey script obtained from the third party.
4. #### Refresh Project
    - Only for content scripts, need to refresh to take effect after the script is modified.
