Considering that some of you may not have web programming experience, the first challenge in using this application is: **What is a T*D selector!**
This is a way to find elements on a webpage. We need to use the browser's built-in debugging tools (F12 or right-click menu *Inspect*).
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and we set styles by setting it.
Some webpages may block the right-click menu and F12, `Browser Menu -> More Tools -> Developer Tools`) to inspect the current element, and then find it based on the element's information.

<Aside>
    Developing content scripts requires using the browser's `Developer Tools`. `Note that all symbols are in English mode`. Selectors can be combined,
    and usually, the selection will match all elements that meet the rules.

### Element Name Selector
Filter by element name, `element name`

Inspection result:
<Code lang='html' code='<div>xxx</div>'/>
Selector:
<Code lang='css' code='div'/>
### Class Name Selector
Filter by class name, `.class name`

Inspection result:
<Code lang='html' code='<div class="box">xxx</div>'/>
Selector:
<Code lang='css' code='.box'/>

### Attribute Selector
Filter by attribute, `[attribute="attribute value"]`

Inspection result:
<Code lang='html' code='<div class="box" title="hello">xxx</div>'/>
Selector:
<Code lang='css' code='[title="hello"] /**or**/ .box[title="hello"]'/>

### Child Element Selector
Filter by attribute, `parent selector space child selector` means all child elements, `parent selector > child selector` means the first level child elements

Inspection result:
<Code lang='html' code='<div class="box"><span class="child">world</span></div>'/>
Selector:
<Code lang='css' code='.box .world /**or**/ .box>.world'/>
